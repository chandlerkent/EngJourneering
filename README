EngJourneering is an easy way to integrate Twitter status updates, GitHub commit messages, and blog posts into a single location to track a project's status.

This was created for easily making engineering journals for Rose-Hulman projects.

This project is currently incomplete. The goal is to have it feature complete (and ready for beta testing) by November 15th.
